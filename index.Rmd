## About Me
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Earth Sciences][msu_des] at Montana State University. I am a human-environment geographer whose work focuses on the interactions between climate, urbanization and food security. 
<br>  
Methodologically, my work in interdisciplinary in nature. I mainly focus on the integration of social and environmental data using GIS and spatial analysis alongside econometric and statistical modelling. Much of the data I use is derived from satellites, where I integrate them with large-scale household surveys in both rural and urban settings. 
<br>

For more information about my research, interests or potential collaboration, please get in touch.
