## About Me
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Earth Sciences][msu_des] at Montana State University
<br>
My current research investigates the dynamics of human-environment relationships between urban growth, demographic change, extreme heat and food security in Africa
<br>
Methodologically, my work in interdisciplinary in nature. I mainly focus on the integration of social and environmental data using GIS and spatial analysis alongside econometric and statistical modelling. Much of the data I use is derrived from satellites, where I integrate them with large-scale household surveys in both rural and urban settings. 
<br>
For more information about my research, interests or potential collaboration, please get in touch.
