## About Me
I am a Geography PhD candidate in the [School of Geography, Development & Environment][sgde] at the University of Arizona.  
<br>
My current research investigates the dynamics of human-environment relationships between agriculture, urban growth and food security in Africa. I am primarily interested in rural-urban linkages between agricultural production and urban food security.  
<br>
Methodologically, my work is interdisciplinary in nature. I mainly focus on the integration of social and environmental data using GIS and spatial analysis alongside econometric and statistical modelling. Much of the data I use comes from large-scale household surveys in both rural and urban settings across Sub-Saharan Africa. I work to couple these household level data with environmental and socio-economic data to examine and understand the spatial dynamics of food systems and food (in)security across southern Africa.
