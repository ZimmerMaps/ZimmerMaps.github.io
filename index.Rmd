## Bio

I am a Geography PhD student in the School of Geography, Development & Environment at the University of Arizona. My current research investigates the dynamics of human-environment relationships including urban growth, agriculture and food security in Africa. I am interested in the linkages between rural agricultural production and urban food security.

Methodologically, much of my work focuses on the integration of social and environmental data, using GIS, spatial analysis, econometric and statistical modeling. I have conducted large-scale household surveys in both rural and urban settings in Kenya and Zambia, which form part of the dataset for my research. I couple these with various environmental and economic datasets to examine the environmental, socio-economic and spatial determinants of household food security within Southern Africa.
