## About Me
I am a Research Scientist in the [Department of Earth Sciences][msu_des] at Montana State University. I am a human-environment geographer and my work mainly focuses on the interactions between climate, urbanization, and food security. 
<br>  
My work is very interdisciplinary and often integrates social and environmental data using GIS and spatial analysis alongside statistic modelling. Much of the data I use is derived from satellites, where I integrate them with large-scale survey or climate data to understand human-environment dynamics.
<br>

For more information about my research, interests, or potential collaboration, please get in touch.
