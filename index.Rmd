## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am a Geography PhD candidate in the [School of Geography, Development & Environment][sgde] at the University of Arizona under the advisement of [Professor Tom Evans][tom].

My current research investigates the dynamics of human-environment relationships between agriculture, urban growth and food security in Africa. I am primarily interested in rural-urban linkages between agricultural production and urban food security.

Methodologically, my work is interdisciplinary in nature. I mainly focus on the integration of social and environmental data using GIS and spatial analysis alongside econometric and statistical modelling. Much of the data I use comes from large-scale household surveys in both rural and urban settings across Sub-Saharan Africa. I work to couple these household level data with environmental and socio-economic data to examine and understand the spatial dynamics of food systems and food (in)security across southern Africa.

For more information about my research, interests or potential collaboration, please get in touch.
